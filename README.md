# Apache FPM container based on phusion
Simple apache-vhost that serves content from /var/www/web - php-requests are
proxied to a linked fpm-container named "fpm" on port 9000.


# Dory

Use the following if you use [dory](https://github.com/FreedomBen/dory) (much of the same applies for  [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) and [dinghy-http-proxy](https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy-http-proxy) which Dory is based on).

```yaml
    environment:
      VIRTUAL_HOST: example.docker
      VIRTUAL_PORT: 80
      # Use the following if you want to handle redirects from http to https yourself.
      HTTPS_METHOD: noredirect

```

## Using autogenerated certificates
This require Dory version 1.0.3, use `dory upgrade` to upgrade

If you don't already have a Dory configuration-file, have it generate one by running `dory config` then update the update `ssl_certs_dir` configuration:

```yaml
  nginx_proxy:
    enabled: true
    container_name: dory_dinghy_http_proxy
    https_enabled: true
    # Update the follow line to point at the dev_certificates
    ssl_certs_dir: <your homedir>/.local/share/dev_certificates
```

Then mount that directory into the apache-fpm container so that its auto-generated certificates will be accessible to Dory.

```yaml
    volumes:
      - '${HOME}/.local/share/dev_certificates:/cert:rw'
```

Then follow the steps in the mkcert sections to specify which certificates to generate and have your OS trust them.

# mkcert

This image has [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)
builtin.

Run `mkcert -install` on your host machine.

Then you add the generated CAROOT as a volume (the path on the host
machine is the output of `mkcert -CAROOT`).

In your `docker-compose.yml` supply one or more host names to be be
used for HTTPS in either:

1. environment variable `MKCERT_DOMAINS`,
1. the environment variable `VIRTUAL_HOST`, or
1. as `hostname` and `domainname` configuration

```yaml
    volumes:
      - '${HOME}/Library/Application Support/mkcert:/mkcert/mac:ro'
      - '${HOME}/.local/share/mkcert:/mkcert/linux:ro'

    environment:
      MKCERT_DOMAINS: "example.docker *.example.docker local.docker"

    hostname: example
    domainname: docker
```

# Full example configuration

```yaml
    volumes:
      - '${HOME}/Library/Application Support/mkcert:/mkcert/mac:ro'
      - '${HOME}/.local/share/mkcert:/mkcert/linux:ro'
      - '${HOME}/.local/share/dev_certificates:/cert:rw'

    environment:
      MKCERT_DOMAINS: "example.docker *.example.docker local.docker"
      VIRTUAL_HOST: example.docker
      VIRTUAL_PORT: 80
      HTTPS_METHOD: noredirect
```
